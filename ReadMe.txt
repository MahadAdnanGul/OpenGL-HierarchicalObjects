The following features are present:

Child parent hierarchy between torso and legs.
Legs consist of two joints that rotate somewhat naturally trying to mimic a walking. (Using forward kinematics)
Legs also move upwards at the start of every stride to prevent the moonwalk effect.
The movement animation is dependant upon the xz velocity of the character.
I added a backdrop and ground by loading a few textures.
Everything is built upon assignment 1, so the trajectory can be defined like before through keyframes using multiple types of interpolation techniques.
